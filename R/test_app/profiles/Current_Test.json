  "user_prompt": "The document is about a PARR agreement (Program for Aquaculture Regulatory Research). Extract the requested fields from the OCR text using only explicit statements. Do not guess or infer.\n\nField-by-field guidance (use these synonyms to find the values):\n\n1) What is the agreement ID\n   Look for: “Agreement ID”, “Agreement Number”, “Agreement No.”, “Project ID”, “Contribution Agreement #”, “Funding Agreement #”, “Reference #”, “File #”.\n   Choose the most clearly labeled agreement identifier.\n\n2) Who is the lead organization\n   Look for: “Lead organization”, “Lead recipient”, “Recipient”, “Organization”, “Institution”, “Company”, “Proponent”, “Applicant”.\n   If both a person name and an organization appear, return the organization.\n\n3) What's the date of the agreement\n   Look for: “Agreement date”, “Effective date”, “Signed date”, “Date signed”, “Executed on”.\n   If only a “Start date” exists, use it ONLY if the text clearly indicates it is the agreement effective date.\n\n4) What is the project duration\n   Look for: “Duration”, “Term”, “Project term”, “Period”, “Start date” and “End date”, or statements like “X months” / “X years”.\n   If start and end dates are explicitly given, return “<start date> to <end date>”.\n   Do NOT calculate the duration unless the document explicitly states the length.\n\n5) What's the title of the agreement\n   Look for: “Agreement title”, “Project title”, “Title”, or the main heading that names the agreement/project.\n   Prefer an explicit label over a guessed heading.\n\n6) What's the total money involved\n   Look for: “Total value”, “Total funding”, “Total amount”, “Total budget”, “Total agreement value”, “Total project cost”.\n   If the text lists components (e.g., “DFO contribution” and “partner contribution”), do NOT add them together unless the document explicitly states the combined total. Prefer the explicit “Total …” line.\n\nDisambiguation:\n- If the document contains multiple agreements/projects, extract the one most clearly associated with PARR (mentions “PARR” in the same section) or the primary/first fully described agreement.\n- If a value is unclear or not stated, leave it empty.\n- Preserve IDs, dates, and currency formatting exactly as written (including $ signs and commas).",
